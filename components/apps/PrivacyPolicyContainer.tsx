          FoodMe promises never to share your personal information with our
          business partners. From time to time, restaurants (Third Party
          Services) listed on our web app will want to reach out to our users
          with special offers. Instead, they will let us know that they want to
          send a message or run a promotion and we will then send that
          information to you. These messages will be in the form of:
          <ul>
            <li>
              an email to the email address you provided when you signed-up, or{' '}
            </li>
            <li>
              a notification and platform message on your FoodMe account.{' '}
            </li>
          </ul>
        </Content>
        <Content>
          The offers will never come directly from Third Party Service providers
          who will not know the name or contact details of users who receive the
          offers. A Third Party Service provider will only learn the identity of
          a user if that user ‘likes’ an offer or otherwise chooses to contact
          the restaurant directly (e.g. by phone, email or a link from our web
          app).
        </Content>
        <Content>
          Although these communications to you will be personalised – for
          instance, addressed to you using your first name - it will be FoodMe
          who has inserted your name and not the Third Party Service provider.
        </Content>
        <Content>
          In return, FoodMe will provide very high-level (anonymised) insights
          about the performance of message campaigns to Third Party Service
          providers. This may include statistical information about how many
          users received the message and clicked on it, but not who received or
          clicked it!
        </Content>
        <Content>
          The number and frequency of messages you receive will depend on:
          <ul>
            <li>
              how many Third Party Services you subscribe to, e.g. when you
              bookmark or ‘favourite’ a restaurant in your search results page
            </li>
            <li>how often any particular restaurant sends offers. </li>
          </ul>

          You can manage these subscriptions via Bookmarks in your profile.
